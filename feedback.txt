Hi Den and Lauren!

Let me start by saying that I love your budget app! I really liked the homepage's introduction, 
reading about you guys, your pictures, I WISH the links were clickable! 

- In the latest version of express, fetch is included! so there is no need to use axios, 
you can convert your axios post requests to regular fetch requests.

- Your filing system is absolutely perfect! I love the use of folders, the front and back in separate folders, the hooks folder, 
the 3 pages of the application. Your server.js file is as clean as a whistle. 
Makes the application understandable, logical and organized.

- I love the use of bootstrap. It looks neat, user-friendly, and simple to operate.

- Good job on the use of comments!

Overall, I absolutely loved your project! Cant wait to see what each of you will do on your final project
Well done guys
